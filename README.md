I am a 25 year old fullstack software engineer from Germany 🇩🇪.

🔨 I'm currently working at [amplimind](https://github.com/amplimind), a joint venture powered by Audi & Lufthansa Industy Solutions as a Fullstack software engineer.

🧑🏻‍💻 I code full-stack, mostly with Java, TypeScript and Spring Boot. I also do a lot of DevOps work with AWS. I also try to automate as much manual work as possible.

⌚️ In my spare time, I code small things and always try to learn new technologies. 

I am also very interested in cars 🚗, home automation 🏡, photography 📸 and anything else related to technology ⚙️ or IT 🧑🏻‍💻.
